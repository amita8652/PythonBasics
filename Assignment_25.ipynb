Each time the yield statement is encountered during iteration, the generator produces a value, suspends its state, and waits for the next iteration."

    "The yield statement in Python serves a crucial purpose in the context of generator functions. Here are its main purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Generating Values: The primary purpose of the yield statement is to produce a value from a generator function. When a generator function encounters a yield statement, it temporarily suspends its execution, returns the yielded value, and saves its state. This allows the generator function to generate values one at a time, lazily and on-demand, rather than computing and returning all values at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resuming Execution: After yielding a value, the generator function's execution is paused. However, it retains its internal state, including variable values and the position of code execution. When the generator is iterated over or its __next__() method is called again, the generator function resumes execution from where it left off, continuing the execution from the line immediately after the yield statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iteration Control: The yield statement provides a mechanism for controlling the iteration process. By yielding values at specific points within the generator function, you can define the sequence and order in which values are generated. This allows you to control the flow of iteration and dynamically generate values based on specific conditions or logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory Efficiency: The yield statement contributes to memory efficiency when working with large sequences of data. Instead of creating and storing all the values in memory at once, a generator function generates values as they are requested, saving memory resources. This is particularly useful when dealing with infinite sequences or when the full sequence is not needed immediately."
