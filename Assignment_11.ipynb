    "Using logging messages is generally considered better than using print() statements for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Configurability: Logging provides a way to configure the behavior of log messages, such as the log level, output format, and destination (console, file, etc.). This allows you to control what gets logged and where it goes without modifying the code. With print(), you need to manually remove or modify print statements when you no longer need them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Granularity and Levels: Logging offers different levels of severity (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL), allowing you to prioritize and filter log messages based on their importance. This makes it easier to focus on specific areas of interest during debugging and troubleshooting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: Logging allows you to capture detailed information, such as timestamps, module names, and line numbers, which can be invaluable for diagnosing issues in complex systems. Additionally, logging supports multiple handlers and formatters, giving you flexibility in how the log messages are processed and presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Production Readiness: Logging is designed to be used in production environments and can handle large-scale logging with minimal performance impact. It provides features like log rotation, log file management, and log level adjustment on the fly, making it suitable for long-running applications."

If the current line contains a function call, it will execute the entire function without stepping into it. This means that the debugger will treat the function call as a single step and will not break into the function's code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step In: The Step In button allows you to step into a function call and move to the first line of the called function. If the current line contains a function call, pressing Step In will take you inside the function and allow you to debug the function's code line by line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step Out: The Step Out button is used when you want to quickly execute the remaining lines of a function and return to the caller. It is useful when you are inside a function and want to quickly exit it without stepping through every line of the function's code. When you press Step Out, the debugger will execute the remaining lines of the current function and then break at the next line of the calling function."
